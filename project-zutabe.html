One of the requirements of the project was to create a new service that makes use of the Bellota building, a former residential building for workers in the area. In addition to the service, we had to present a proposal for its business model, branding and the analysis of the economic viability of the service.</p>

In the initial phase, I was one responsible for gathering and synthesising information about the context of the project. Later on, I took part in the design of the service system. Finally, I was responsible for defining the layout of the building and designing its interior according to the brand identity created.</p>

                    <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-3">To face this ambiguous challenge, we followed the DBZ-MU methodology, a people-centred innovation methodology based on the principles of design thinking and iterative processes to reach the solution that best responds to the needs of users and customer requirements.</p>
                    <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-3">The first step of the process involved a research phase consisting of desk research and field research activities. Then, we did a synthesis activity to cluster all the information gathered and get qualitative insights for creating design hypotheses.</p>
                    <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-3">After clustering insights, we began to ideate different solutions that could meet them. After checking the ideas with users, we chose the idea that best meets our criteria and the user's opinion. Then we focused on developing further the idea by using tools like user profiles, system maps and user flows.</p>
                    <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-3">After, we defined the service completely, created a brand identity for it, and developed an economic viability plan. Finally, to make the service tangible for the client, we recreated some service touchpoints.</p>

                        <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-6">To begin with, we analysed the context in which the challenge is set. We familiarised ourselves with the town of Legazpi, the current state of society in Gipuzkoa and the generational gap, what intergenerationality is and its benefits for young people, the elderly and the community as a whole, and we identified intergenerational programmes and good practices in the Basque Country.</p>

                        <p class="font-f-secondary font-s-18 font-w-400 line-h-16 mb-3">We continued to analyse the different generations that can be found in the town of Legazpi, as well as to understand the connections and dependencies that one generation has with respect to the others. We did this through interviews with the citizens of the village, guerrilla sessions and questionnaires. All the information we collected was used to project an archetype for each generation.</p>
